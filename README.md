# Favero_Light_Relay

Uses a Lolin D1 Mini Wemos to parse the data output from a Favero Full-Arm-05 to actuate two relays. One for the Left/Red Light and one for the Right/Green Light.

It powers the attached lights via an external 15 Volt, 5 Amp power supply and the relays are power by the Wemos board via a USB power connectino.
